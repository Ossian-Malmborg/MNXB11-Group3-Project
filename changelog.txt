    1. Attempted to plot the temperature on a given day by extracting the cleaned data. Sent it to Sofia as I had some ROOT issues. No commits made. I had cleaned the data for a differnet data set before merging the groups; however, I just had to change the original SMHI data file for the chosen data for this group.
